# Contribution Guidelines

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure you put things in the right category!
- Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
- Do not use words that are clearly implied in the description, such as  `for Tauri`, `a Tauri plugin`.
- The description should be short (one sentence in 24 words, no expanded explanation) and meaningful without using emoji.
- Do not use words that are not relevant to the description such as `Super-Fast` or `Super-Super-Fast`.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[title](link) - Description.`
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Apps

Apps gives he opportunity to showcase the awesome things we can build with Tauri. When submitting your app, make sure it also adheres to the following:

- The app is using Tauri.
- The app is original and not too simple.
- Tauri goes to great lengths to enable fast, lightweight and secure apps. Therefore we expect featured apps to make a (reasonable) effort to be fast, lightweight and secure.
- If you're submitting a closed source app, include evidence of it being built with Tauri.

## Violations

Please notice that entries that violate any of the above guidelines can be removed. We tend to be lenient and give you the benefit of the doubt, but spam, malware, projects not using tauri or repeat offenders will get removed.
